/**
 * Assignment Name (eg U1-3 Extension)
 * Class/File name (eg StringReplace)
 * Purpose: The purpose of this extension is to try your hand at manual string replacement. â€“ the overall goal is to find a substring
within a bigger string and then replacing that substring with something else.
 * @author: salam.1
 * Test Cases:   
 * I used "I am the coolest kid on the block" as my string stored as one.
 * With this I used the substring "est" which resulted in it removed from the string.
 * I tested this as I knew what the string before and after comes in the string, which I can type out quickly.
 *
